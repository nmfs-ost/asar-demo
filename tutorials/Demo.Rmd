## Welcome

The `asar` R package is a tool intended to improve and streamline the workflows of stock assessment scientists focusing on reporting. The following instructions will guide the user on how to efficiently use the tool. The other articles available on this website will provide descriptions of other tools that will help a user implement this package into their workflow.

This tutorial is an extension of the example presented on the [home page](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/).

## TLDR

Below is a shortened demonstration of some of the content in this tutorial:

## Background

In this tutorial, you will be working to recreate the 2023 Petral sole stock assessment report. The materials you might need such as example data can be found [here](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar-demo/tree/main/data). Additionally, to check your work, there is an [additional folder](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar-demo/tree/main/stock_assessment_reports) containing the files that should be produced if you want to recreate this example.

### Species Background

Petrale sole is a right-eyed flounder ranging from the western Gulf of Alaska to the Coronado Islands in northern Baja California. It is often referred to as brill, California sole, Jordan's flounder, cape sole, and other additional common names. The stock has consistently been the most commercially valuable flatfish in the California Current Ecosystem and has been sought after since the late 19th century. This stock was last assessed in 2023 by NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center. The following example will recreate the [stock assessment report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2024/02/status-of-petrale-sole-eopsetta-jordanialong-the-u-s-west-coast-in-2023.pdf/) published by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC). Additional assessments from the PFMC can be found online [here](https://www.pcouncil.org/stock-assessments-star-reports-stat-reports-rebuilding-analyses-terms-of-reference/groundfish-stock-assessment-documents/).

## Prerequisites

### Package Download

To begin please download the following packages

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nmfs-ost/asar")
remotes::install_github("nmfs-ost/satf")
```

## Set Working Directory

Additionally, please set your working directory to the folder you want the files created from this package to remain. The `create_template` function in asar will create a standardized folder structure to store all of the files, but you as the user need to identify where they should be placed.

Tip: if a working directory is not set manually, the function will default to the default working directory in R found in Tools > Global Options > General.

## Create blank R script

This script will be the way you execute the primary functions of this package and create a template for a stock assessment report. It can be helpful to save this script for later use or future assessments.

## Relative Paths

It is recommended to use a method to create relative paths to files such as the `here` package. The here function creates a file that allows R to create a path to a folder without having the user manually write out the path. The way to use this is to download the packages, run the function `here`after setting the working directory. 

```
install.packages("here")
here::here()
```

The user can now designate paths within the folder containing the 'here' file. Note: the file will be hidden within the Rstudio interface, but can be seen in File explorer or an equal local file location. 

Example:

```
output <- load(here::here("data", "Report.sso))
```

## Locate Model Ouptut File

To help streamline the report writing process, an additional R package that compliments asar was developed called satf. This package contains pre-coded tables (flextable) and figure (ggplot2) using a standardized framework of data produced from the function `convert_output` in `asar`. 

For this step we recommend either placing the model results file for either Stock Synthesis (SS3) or Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM) into your working directory. For SS3, this is the Report.sso file and for BAM this is the .rdat file produced after running the ADMB2R routines. 

The petrale sole output file is located [here](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/tree/main/data/Report.sso) for users to download and try themselves.

## Getting Started

We recommend converting your output file outside of the create_template function for large and/or complex data sets. There are two options for running this function.

1) (Recommended) Save the output as a .csv then reload into your R environment 

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
asar::convert_output(
  output_file = "Report.sso",
  outdir = getwd(), # or wherever you saved the example output file
  model = "SS3",
  file_save = TRUE,
  savedir = getwd(),
  save_name = "petrale_sole_std_output"
)
```

2) Save as an object in your environment

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
output <- asar::convert_output(
  output_file = "Report.sso",
  outdir = getwd(),
  model = "SS3"
)
```

**Note:** for users converting results from BAM, you will need to define an additional argument of fleet names in the form of the acronyms used in the file. This will hopefully be deprecated in the future. 

## Run create_template

Define your arguments for creating a stock assessment report template. Running the function without any arguments will produce a blank report, but will not be organized in the standard file framework. 

Recommended minimum arguments:

  - office
  - region (if applicable)
  - species
  - spp_latin
  - year (if different than the current year)
  
```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
asar::create_template(
  format = "pdf",
  office = "NWFSC",
  region = "U.S. West Coast",
  species = "Petrale sole",
  spp_latin = "Eopsetta jordani",
  year = 2023,
  author = c("Ian G. Taylor", "Vladlena Gertseva", "Nick Tolimieri"),
  include_affiliation = TRUE,
  simple_affiliation = FALSE,
  param_names = c("nf","sf"),
  param_values = c("North fleet", "South fleet"),
  resdir = here(), # indicate where the model output is located
  model_results = "petrale_convert_output.csv", # converted model output
)
```

## Create_template Customizations

There are a variety of ways to customize the default template that allows the analyst to expand or change their report as needed. 

### Affiliation Formatting

The user has the option to select multiple ways to report affiliations of assessment authors. The default is a "simple" affiliation which only sites the institution that the author(s) is associated with negating the address afterwards. All other affiliations will include each author's institution name and address.

```
author:
  - name: 'Ian G. Taylor'
    affiliations:
      - name: 'NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center'
        address: '2725 Montlake Boulevard East'
        city: 'Seattle'
        state: 'WA'
        postal-code: '98112-2097'
```

The option to remove affiliation altogether is present by setting
`include_affiliation = FALSE`.

Note: While we have made efforts to create an extensive list of assessment authors across NOAA, there may be instances where you or a colleague does not have their associated affiliation since they are not in our database. In this case, you can submit an [issue here](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/issues/19) and you will be added as soon as possible.

### Parameterization

The skeleton is by default parameterized to allow the user to reference commonly used terms or quantities. The default parameters are species, office, and region (is applicable).

Two arguments in the function allow the user to add more parameters:
  - `param_names`
  - `param_values`
  
To use these parameters, use the following notation while writing text:
```
'r params$species`
```
Additional parameters can be added using the argument:

  - `param_names`
  - `param_values`

For including more than one new parameter please list them using `c()`.
For example:

```r
param_names = c("fleet1", "fleet2", )
```

### Section Customizations



## What to expect

### Skeleton Pop-up

During processing, you will see progress for the template being built in the R console. A message is displayed that let's you know where the template was saved and to fill out the template.

`asar` is only a partially automated tool that still requires the analyst to complete the bulk of the content in the report. Future release will allow the user to call on old assessments that were made using `asar::create_template`, so only minor adjustments will be made as needed by the current assessment.

### Sections

There will be a series of quarto (.qmd) files along with some others generated with the folder. The user will not need to modify the 'skeleton.qmd', but all other quarto files will need to be filled in. 

![](images/example-pop-up.png)

Each section quarto file contains pre-built heading tags and subsections with details indicating what the user should touch on for each section. 

![](images/example-section.png)

The optional addition of new sections as indicated by the user in the `create_template` function will be blank with the exception of a pre-built header with the new section name. 

  - Indicate the new section name (more than one section can be added using `c()`)
  - Indicate the placement of the section relative to the base sections (cases with more than one new sections added relative to another section will be added in the order listed)

```
new_section = "Management"
section_location = "after-modeling_approach"
```

## Rendering

After filling out all sections (and leaving ones that are not applicable with a blanket statement), it is time to produce the pdf report. User should click the 'render' button at the top of the script when using R studio or run the following code in their **terminal**:

```
quarto render SAR_USWC_Petrale_sole_skeleton.qmd
```

![](images/example-pop-up-highlight.png)

## Figure and Table Chunks

In the `tables.qmd` and `figures.qmd` quarto files located in your folder, there will be a series of pre-made tables and figures that includes pre-written generic captions and alternative text. You are able to include or not include these objects at will. We recommend not to, but if a table or figure doesn't apply, you are able to prevent the object from being added to the report by changing the option of **eval** to false.

Here is an example:

```{r}
#| label: 'recruitment'
#| echo: false 
#| warning: false 
#| eval: false 
#| fig-cap: "Recruitment over time of this species in the region."
#| fig-alt: "Graph of recruitment over time. Data can be found at the species folder at the Pacific Fisheries Management Council."
satf::plot_recruitment(dat = 'C:/Users/samantha.schiano/Documents/asar_live_demo/Report.sso', model = 'SS3')
```


You can also adjust figure captions and alternative text from the arguments `fig-cap` and `fig-alt`. These two areas contain pre-generated generic text that applies to the table/figure. To edit, simply madke changes to the sentence(s) between the quotation marks.
